# VGArchive Theme App

This is VGArchive's theme. It uses the [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) color palette, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) + [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com) for the components and CSS.

This stack was chosen for development speed. Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI are a very powerful duo, and allows us to get a lot of mileage out of simple CSS.
The Catppuccin color palette was chosen due to its strong focus on Accessibility, as this is a major focus of this project.
Using the Catppuccin colors properly allows us to guarantee WCAG 2.2 Level AA contrast on all colors, ensuring a proper accessibility baseline.

The rest of the site's design is also accessibility-focused, using large fonts, clearly distinguishable buttons, and other techniques to ensure that the site is as accessible as possible.

Please do reach out if you have any questions at all about this, we(mainly dish) will be glad to explain our focus on accessibility and how we do so!
